# Traveling to Shenzhen

To travel to Shenzhen, you'll be landing in the Hong Kong airport. There is a ferry from inside the airport that will take you straight over to Shenzhen but the last ferry runs at 20:00 and the flights I always end up on arrive after 21:00. The SkyCity Marriott (+852-3969 1888) is right across the street from the airport and there is a shuttle that runs from Terminal 2, Bay 29 every half hour. To get to Shenzhen the next morning, take the shuttle back to Terminal 2 then head out to the [bus station](http://www.lwb.hk/en/GTC.html) where you can purchase a ticket for the A43/A43P route that goes to the [Sheung Shei train station](http://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/services/system_map.html) where you can board the train for Lok Ma Chau, here you can walk across the border at the Futian Checkpoint and board [Line #4](http://www.szmc.net/page/html5en.html) to the Civic Center stop where you can change to Line #2 and head to Sea World. When you buy the train token, don't buy one for the Civic Center and then buy another one when you get there for Sea World, otherwise you will need to leave the secured part of the station and re-check your bags through the x-ray machine. Just buy a token to Line #2 Sea World. Alternately there are numerous taxis waiting at the Futian Checkpoint that will take you to Sea World for about $10
